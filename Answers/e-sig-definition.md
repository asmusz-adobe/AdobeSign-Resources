Of course you can read the Wikipedia definition here, but I’m going to attempt to make it a bit more conceptual and simple. There are many legal descriptions under many different national, and international laws but I’m not a lawyer and that’s really boring stuff anyway.

Before we get too far into “the weeds” on what electronic signatures are, lets talk about how they work, or what they do.

An electronic signature does (at a high level) 3 things:

1.  Captures the “intent to sign”.
2.  Identifies the “signers” (or other possible “participants”) in some way.
3.  Captures the date and time the signature took place. Additionally (but not necessarily required for legality) it captures the “location” the signing took place.

That’s pretty much it!  See, I told you I’d make it simple! 🙂

Now … some/most laws pertaining to e-signature add some additional things, which mainly consist of these additional safeguards:

A way to show that the “agreement” between parties has not been changed in any material way from the “original”.
A documented “chain of events” that shows the steps of the process of obtaining said signatures.
Additional “Identity Verification” to help prove that the persons involved were “who they said they were”.
Even when talking about government regulations such as CFR 21 part 11 (FDA regulations for “life sciences” and drug trials) There are additional things to consider but they comprise a list of additional “processes” related to the points above.
