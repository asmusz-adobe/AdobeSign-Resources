### Why can't I add someuser.last@somedomain.com as a user to my Adobe Sign account?

This is likey a "privacy issue".  In most cases you are adding a user on your company's domain and this is generally not an issue if that person has never yet sent or signed an Adobe Sign agreement using that email address.  If they have though, because we don't know what it was that they may have associated to that email address, we can't just add that user to the "corporate" account.

If you think about this, in some scenarios, they may have signed something of a personal nature.  They should NOT have used their corporate email address for this but it's possible that they did it without thinking about the consequences.  Once they're added to the corporate account, at minimum, administrators will be able to run reports that show at least the agreement name in that report.  This could possibly be a HIPPA or other data privacy violation.

For these reasons we do not allow admins to add "PENDING" (users that have signed something) or "ACTIVE" (users who are already senders in some other account) to thier business/corporate account "automatically".  

#### How do we handle this?

You will need to [open a case with support](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/sign.html) and they can work with that person directly. In most cases this will mean they need to change the email address associated to the existing user to one of their own "personal" email addresses (yahoo, google, outlook.com, etc.). Once this is done, the admin of the corporate/business related account will be able to add them as "net new" in that account.
